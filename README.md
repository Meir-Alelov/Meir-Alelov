## Hello, hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about deploying innovative environmental tech to catalyze a shift in the world for a more sustainable, harmonious, and resilient future. 

I'm an exceptionally curious, pragmatic, forever-student who has a knack for working on data-driven solutions to environmental issues. With the industry experience and outlook of a servant leader, the technical skills of a data scientist, and the non-violent communication of a yoga teacher, I lead successful teams of incredible people in assessing the scientific rigor and scalability of potential environmental technology investments.


### Featured Projects
[Natural Product Classifier](https://github.com/Meir-Alelov/Natural-Product-Classifier) - Gradient Boosting Classifier which accurately predicts the ontology of unknown natural products. This tool provides key insights into experimental procedures catered toward drug discovery, and can therefore significantly increase efficiency of drug discovery pipelines.

[Deep Learning Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/Meir-Alelov/Deep_Learning_Pneumonia_Detection) - CNN model which accurately classifies pediatric chest X-ray images as positive/negative for pneumonia. Potential use as an important tool to reduce childhood mortality, especially in impoverished regions with less access to advanced healthcare systems.

[Flu Shot Classifier](https://github.com/Meir-Alelov/Flu-Shot-Classifier) - Applied machine learning to understand predictors of vaccination rates and provided actionable recommendations. Explored data ethics to shed light on the responsibility of data scientists and need for ethical AI.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on optimizing computer vision for environmental technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about deep learning models for time series forecasting.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various deep learning projects.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not teaching yoga or uncovering ancient Vedic secrets, you can find me riding my Harley Iron 883, organizing beach cleanups, reading up on Black History, dispersed camping, playing the sax, permaculture farming, surfing, and hiking. 

My goal is to live sustainably, off-grid, with a mindful footprint; this lifestyle is reflected in my work.
